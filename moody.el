;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides utilities for displaying elements of the
;; mode line as tabs and ribbons.  It also provides replacements
;; for a few built-in elements.

;; The biggest differences to similar packages is that this one is
;; much simpler and much more consistent.  When using this package,
;; then only the color of the mode line changes when a window
;; becomes in-/active.  Other packages additionally change what
;; elements are being displayed and also the appearance of an
;; individual element may change completely, which I found highly
;; distracting when trying out those packages, because I never knew
;; what visual clues to look for in order to find a certain piece
;; of information.

;; Usage:

;; * Make sure that the face `mode-line' does not set `:box' and
;;   that either `:underline' and `:overline' are the same color
;;   and the `:position' property of `:underline' is non-nil, or
;;   `:underline' and `:overline' are both `undefined'.  If
;;   defined, then the line color should be different from the
;;   `:background' colors of both `mode-line' and `default'.  The
;;   same rules apply to `mode-line-inactive'.  The line colors of
;;   `mode-line' and `mode-line-inactive' do not necessarily have
;;   to be identical.  For example:
;;
;;     (use-package solarized-theme
;;       :config
;;       (load-theme 'solarized-light t)
;;       (let ((line (face-attribute 'mode-line :underline)))
;;         (set-face-attribute 'mode-line          nil :overline   line)
;;         (set-face-attribute 'mode-line          nil :underline  (:color line :position t))
;;         (set-face-attribute 'mode-line-inactive nil :overline   line)
;;         (set-face-attribute 'mode-line-inactive nil :underline  (:color line :position t))
;;         (set-face-attribute 'mode-line          nil :box        nil)
;;         (set-face-attribute 'mode-line-inactive nil :box        nil)
;;         (set-face-attribute 'mode-line-inactive nil :background "#f9f2d9")))
;;
;;   If your Emacs version is older than 29.1, then the `:underline'
;;   attribute does not accept the `:position' property, so you should
;;   set `:underline' to simply `line' in the above example.

;; * Note that the above example is for `solarized-theme' and that for
;;   your theme (face-attribute 'mode-line :underline) may return nil.
;;   If you want borders, use something like (let ((line "red")) ...),
;;   in that case.

;; * Add something like this to your init file:
;;
;;     (use-package moody
;;       :config
;;       (setq x-underline-at-descent-line t)
;;       (moody-replace-mode-line-buffer-identification)
;;       (moody-replace-vc-mode)
;;       (moody-replace-eldoc-minibuffer-message-function))
;;
;;   If your Emacs version is older than 29.1, then include
;;   (setq x-underline-at-descent-line t) in addition to the above.

;; * Such replacement functions are defines as commands, making it
;;   quicker to try them out without having to add anything to your
;;   init file.

;; * To undo the call to a `moody-replace-*' function, call the same
;;   function with t as the value of the optional REVERSE argument.
;;   You can accomplish the same by interactively calling such a
;;   function with a prefix argument to do so.

a number here.  If you use a function instead, then that ends
up being called a lot.

Increasing the height of the mode-line triggers a bug in Emacs
releases before version 29.1, causing only parts of the buffer
to be displayed in the window even though it would fit exactly.
Moody provides a workaround but that in turn can result in some
flickering.  If you notice such flickering and it bothers you,
then either update to Emacs 29.1, or do not increase the height
of the mode-line."

and certain other calculations have not yet taken place for the

These calculations can be triggered by calling `redisplay'
explicitly at the appropriate time and this functions purpose
is to make it easier to do so.

This function is like `redisplay' with non-nil FORCE argument,

from that of the `default' face.  This function is intended to
