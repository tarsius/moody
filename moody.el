;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides utilities for displaying elements of the
;; mode line as tabs and ribbons.  It also provides replacements
;; for a few built-in elements.

;; The biggest differences to similar packages is that this one is
;; much simpler and much more consistent.  When using this package,
;; then only the color of the mode line changes when a window
;; becomes in-/active.  Other packages additionally change what
;; elements are being displayed and also the appearance of an
;; individual element may change completely, which I found highly
;; distracting when trying out those packages because I never know
;; what visual clues to look for in order to find a certain piece
;; of information.

;; Usage:

;; * Make sure that the face `mode-line' does not set `:box' and
;;   that `:underline' and `:overline' are the same color or are
;;   both `undefined'.  If defined, then the line color should be
;;   different from the `:background' colors of both `mode-line'
;;   and `default'.  The same rules apply to `mode-line-inactive'.
;;   The line colors of `mode-line' and `mode-line-inactive' do
;;   not necessarily have to be identical.  For example:
;;
;;     (use-package solarized-theme
;;       :config
;;       (load-theme 'solarized-light t)
;;       (let ((line (face-attribute 'mode-line :underline)))
;;         (set-face-attribute 'mode-line          nil :overline   line)
;;         (set-face-attribute 'mode-line-inactive nil :overline   line)
;;         (set-face-attribute 'mode-line-inactive nil :underline  line)
;;         (set-face-attribute 'mode-line          nil :box        nil)
;;         (set-face-attribute 'mode-line-inactive nil :box        nil)
;;         (set-face-attribute 'mode-line-inactive nil :background "#f9f2d9")))

;; * Add something like this to your init file:
;;
;;     (use-package moody
;;       :config
;;       (setq x-underline-at-descent-line t)
;;       (moody-replace-mode-line-buffer-identification)
;;       (moody-replace-vc-mode))

;; * Such replacement functions are defines as commands, making it
;;   quicker to try them out without having to add anything to your
;;   init file.

;; * To undo the call to a `moody-replace-*' function, call the same
;;   function with t as the value of the optional REVERSE argument.
;;   You can accomplish the same by interactively calling such a
;;   function with a prefix argument to do so.
